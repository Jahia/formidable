/**
 * Manual-testing playground provisioning — NOT a test.
 *
 * Rebuilds the Formidable test site with a ready-to-use set of published live
 * forms, so the whole UI and submission process can be exercised by hand on a
 * stable model. Run it with: yarn playground (from the tests/ folder).
 *
 * The forms live under /sites/<site>/contents/forms/playground, each on a page of its own
 * under /sites/<site>/home (<form name>-page), all with a save-to-JCR action so the results
 * screens can be exercised. Every form comes in TWO looks, told apart by the prefix of its
 * name and of its title:
 *   - css-*    "CSS - …"    the sample theme (registration-yellow-theme.css) in the form's
 *                           "Custom CSS" property: a business stylesheet on top of the modules'
 *                           markup, the case the authoring UI (Page Builder zones, boxes) must
 *                           stay readable in
 *   - plain-*  "Plain - …"  no css property: the modules' own look, the markup and the class
 *                           hooks as the styling contract (docs/styling/) describes them
 * The forms:
 *   - simple      minimal contact form, the visitor named by a first and a last name so that
 *                 each maps to its own visitor-profile property; a select drives a conditional
 *                 phone field
 *   - newsletter  a second small form, shown only on the two-forms page below
 *   - steps       three-step form with navigation (step 2 holds a fieldset, the deepest
 *                 authoring level, and the delivery method drives a field and that fieldset)
 *   - complete    every built-in field type (same set as spec 20), the visitor profile fields
 *                 first (mapped, prefilled, then the sensitive one), and the whole options matrix
 *                 — manual, options source, category and content, each single and multiple, every
 *                 field with words of its own (the content ones point at texts under
 *                 contents/agencies and contents/services; the agencies hold an unpublished draft
 *                 to showcase that only published contents reach live)
 *   - languages   a choice field whose French labels are half translated, to try the site's
 *                 "replace untranslated content" setting both ways
 * And one page per look holding two forms, <look>-two-forms-page: the simple form (referenced)
 * next to the newsletter one — the case a page with one form never shows (two results sets,
 * two mappings, one tracking script).
 *
 * jContent's trees (pages, content folders) list nodes in creation order, so the set is created
 * in the order a reader expects to find it: the looks by label, and within a look the forms by
 * title — CSS before Plain, Complete form first, Two forms on one page last.
 *
 * When formidable-jexperience-engine is on the instance, the simple and the complete forms map their
 * fields to jCustomer's default visitor profile properties (firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber,
 * birthDate, gender, kids, countryName), one field per form is marked sensitive, and jExperience is
 * enabled on the site — so a publication writes the mapping rules and a live submission feeds the
 * profile. The two shapes jCustomer's default schema has no property for — a multi-valued string for the
 * checkbox group, a boolean for the newsletter switch — get one in a "Formidable playground" card, created
 * once through jExperience's admin proxy. Without the module the same forms are provisioned, mappings left
 * out: nothing here depends on it. The yarn script runs the browser under a plain Chrome user agent: the tracker
 * carries the crawler-user-agents list, which names HeadlessChrome, and would otherwise start in its fallback mode
 * and send nothing for the sample submissions.
 *
 * All editorial values are provided in both site languages (en and fr), so the
 * localized rendering and editing can be exercised too. The sourced country
 * select carries an empty-option label in both languages to showcase the
 * native required validation on the site.
 *
 * It also declares the options sources in the OSGi config (countries + two
 * static lists of the fmdbSampleStaticList initializer of
 * formidable-test-module-samples-java, the screen types and how you watch),
 * creates the sample category trees product/tv and product/audio the
 * category-mode fields point at and the contents/agencies and
 * contents/services folders the content-mode ones read, and
 * provisions the results reader user john-doe (password John#1234, kept on
 * the server across runs, site member as editor) with fmdb-results-reader
 * granted on the two simple forms only — to test the results access rights.
