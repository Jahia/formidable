# Formidable tests

Cypress project for the Formidable modules. It targets a running Jahia instance
(default: `http://localhost:8080`, credentials from `.env` / `set-env.sh`).

## Running the test suites

```bash
yarn e2e:ci      # full headless run (what CI executes)
yarn e2e:debug   # interactive Cypress runner
yarn typecheck   # type-checks the whole suite (specs, support, page objects) in a second
```

## Manual-testing playground

```bash
yarn playground
```

Rebuilds the `FormidableSite4Tests` site with a ready-to-use, published set of
live forms for manual UI and submission testing (this is provisioning, not a
test — CI never runs it). The forms sit in the content folder
`/sites/FormidableSite4Tests/contents/forms/playground`, each on a page of its own under
`/sites/FormidableSite4Tests/home` (`<form name>-page.html`), and every one of them comes in
two looks, told apart by the prefix of its name and title. The nodes are created in title
order (CSS before Plain, Complete form first), which is the order jContent's trees show them in:

| Look | Prefix | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **CSS** | `css-` / "CSS - …" | The sample theme (`jahia-test-module/sample-form-css/registration-yellow-theme.css`) in the form's **Custom CSS** property — a business stylesheet on top of the modules' markup, the case the authoring UI must stay readable in |
| **Plain** | `plain-` / "Plain - …" | No `css` property — the modules' own look, the markup and the class hooks as [the styling contract](../docs/styling/README.md) describes them |

| Form | Content |
|---|---|
| `simple` | Minimal contact form (published in EN and FR, custom required messages on the name fields, a select revealing a conditional phone field); its fields map to the visitor profile when jExperience is there, see below |
| `newsletter` | Two small fields; only on the two-forms page |
| `steps` | Three-step form with navigation, a fieldset inside step 2 and conditional logic driven by the delivery method |
| `complete` | Every built-in field type, in three blocks: the visitor profile fields first (mapped and prefilled when jExperience is there, then the sensitive one), the other field types, and the choice fields completing the options matrix below |
| `languages` | Choice field whose French labels are only half translated, to try the site's *Replace untranslated content with the default language content* setting both ways |
| `<look>-two-forms-page` | A page holding the simple form (referenced) next to the newsletter one: two results sets, two mappings, one tracking script |

The complete form covers every options mode of a choice field, single and multiple:

| Options mode | Single | Multiple |
|---|---|---|
| Manual (options typed by the author) | `gender`, `deliveryMethod` (radio), `department` (select) | interests (checkbox group) |
| Options source (declared in the module configuration) | `country` (select, `countries`) | `viewing` (checkbox group, a static list: Streaming, Cable, Satellite, Antenna) |
| Category (children of a picked category) | `tvCategory` (radio, `product/tv`: Plasma, OLED, LED) | `audioCategories` (checkbox group, `product/audio`: Headphones, Speakers, Soundbar) |
| Content (nodes under a picked root) | `agency` (select, texts under `contents/agencies`) | `services` (multiple select, texts under `contents/services`) |

Every field has an option set of its own, so no two of them read as one field repeated.

All forms carry a save-to-JCR action, so submissions land in the results
screens. The script also:

- declares the `optionsSources` module configuration (`countries`, plus `tv`
  and `viewing` backed by the static `fmdbSampleStaticList` initializer of
  formidable-test-module-samples-java — `tv` with a localized label, offered in
  the editor and used by no field);
- creates and publishes the sample categories
  `/sites/systemsite/categories/product/tv/{plasma,oled,led}` and
  `product/audio/{headphones,speakers,soundbar}` the category-mode fields point at;
- provisions the results reader user **john-doe / John#1234** (server-level,
  kept across runs, site member as editor) with `fmdb-results-reader` granted
  on the two simple forms only — to exercise the results access rights.

Prerequisites: current `formidable-engine`, `formidable-elements`,
`formidable-extended-inputs` and `formidable-test-module-samples-java`
deployed on the target instance.

`yarn playground:maintenance` adds, on its own, a form with no repository-writing
action (`maintenance-free`, the contrast case for the read-only maintenance mode) to the
same folder, which it creates if the main script has not run yet.

### With jExperience

When `formidable-jexperience-engine` is deployed (the script asks the repository for its
mapping mixin, and goes on without mappings when the type is unknown), the playground also
enables jExperience and the module on the site, and maps the two contact forms to jCustomer's
default visitor profile properties, so the whole chain — editor section, mapping rule written at
publication, submission event, profile update — is testable at once:

| Form | Field | Profile property | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| *rule* | *a required field* | | *always set: the visitor just stated it* |
| *rule* | *an optional field* | | *set if missing: it completes the profile, never overrides it* |
| *rule* | *an identifying value a later submission should not overwrite* (`email`) | | *set if missing even when required* |
| simple | `firstName`, `lastName` | `firstName`, `lastName` | always set, prefill on |
| simple | `email` | `email` | set if missing, prefill on |
| simple | `phoneNumber` (shown when a call is asked for, masked `+99 9 99 99 99 99`) | `phoneNumber` | set if missing, prefill on — a field the logic hides is prefilled all the same, and shows its value once revealed |
| simple | `message` | — | marked **sensitive**: never leaves the site |
| complete | `email` | `email` | set if missing, prefill on |
| complete | birth date | `birthDate` | always set, prefill on |
| complete | `gender` (radio) | `gender` | set if missing, prefill on |
| complete | `kids` (number, default 1) | `kids` | set if missing, prefill on with **Replace the field's default value** ticked — the one field where the profile replaces an author's default |
| complete | `country` (sourced select, ISO codes) | `countryName` | set if missing, prefill on — the select is the shape a guard reading the live state mistakes for a visitor's choice |
| complete | interests (checkbox group) | `formidableInterests` — multi-valued, playground card | always set, prefill on — the multi-valued shape |
| complete | `newsletter` (switch) | `formidableOptIn` — boolean, playground card | set if missing, prefill on — the boolean shape |
| complete | employee code | — | marked **sensitive** |

jCustomer's default schema has no multi-valued and no boolean property, so the script creates the two
it needs in a **Formidable playground** card of the visitor profile (through jExperience's admin proxy,
once; a jCustomer that cannot be reached is logged and the two mappings are simply skipped at
publication). The other choice fields stay unmapped. The sample submissions the script makes at the end run
through the live pages, so with the tracker on the site they reach jCustomer as `form` events and
the mapped values land on one visitor's profile (all of them are one Cypress visitor, so the
profile ends with the last values — and keeps the first email, which is set only if missing).
For that the run declares a plain Chrome user agent: the tracker's own crawler list names
HeadlessChrome and would otherwise start in fallback mode and send nothing. The mapping rules of
the previous run's forms are deleted from jCustomer before the site is, so they do not pile up.

The script lives in `cypress/playground/provision-forms.play.ts`; the `.play.ts`
extension keeps it outside the Cypress spec pattern used by the test runs.
