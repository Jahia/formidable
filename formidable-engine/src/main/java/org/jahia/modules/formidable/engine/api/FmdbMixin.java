/**
 * The mixins the engine's own CND declares — the extension surface of Formidable. A field type,
 * an action or a container declared in another module takes part in engine behaviour by applying
 * one of these, and server-side code asks for the mixin rather than for a concrete type name:
 * a third-party number field is a number field to the engine exactly as the built-in one is.
 * See docs/architecture/cnd-module-ownership.md.
 * <p>
 * Two mixins are missing on purpose: the one-shot markers of the 0.4 content migrations
 * ({@code fmdbmix:elementsReactivated}, {@code fmdbmix:migratedChoiceOptions}). Each records
 * that a migration has already healed a node, which is the engine talking to itself; their
 * declarations outlive the migrations, so that content still carrying one stays valid, but
 * publishing the names would freeze as contract something no other module has a reason to
 * read. They stay with the migrations, in {@code migration/MigrationMarker}.
 * <p>
 * These are compile-time constants — see {@link FmdbNodeType} for what that implies.
