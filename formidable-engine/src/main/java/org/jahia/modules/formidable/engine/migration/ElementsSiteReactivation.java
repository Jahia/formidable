/**
 * Re-enables formidable-elements on the sites that carry forms but lost the module from
 * their installed list. The 0.3 → 0.4 upgrade goes through an uninstall/reinstall (the
 * module identity changed): the uninstall drops the module from every site's
 * {@code j:installedModules}, the new-identity install does not re-add it, and the site
 * then renders broken forms and a broken editor while the definitions and the migrated
 * content are perfectly fine — the single most misleading state of the whole upgrade.
 *
 * <p>The site node keeps no trace of the departed module, so the reliable signal is the
 * CONTENT: a site holding {@code fmdb:form} nodes used the module. That derivation is
 * deliberately NOT perpetual: each healed site is stamped with the
 * {@code fmdbmix:elementsReactivated} marker and never touched again — an administrator
 * who later deactivates the module on purpose while keeping the form content (a site
 * being decommissioned, archived content that must stop rendering) is respected, at
 * every restart. A site whose admin removed both the module and its forms is never
 * selected in the first place.
 *
 * <p>The redeploy event fires from both the START and the STOP of the elements module.
 * On the stop-fired one — step 2 of the documented upgrade, where the operator is
 * deliberately uninstalling it — there is nothing to reinstall, and trying would log a
 * misleading error in the very log the upgrade notes tell the operator to watch. The
 * run is therefore gated on the package being STARTED or on its way there: at the
 * start-fired event the module state is still STARTING (verified on a live replay — a
 * STARTED-only gate leaves the healing silently inert on its main path), so the gate
 * refuses only an absent or stopping package.
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle: upgrade healing introduced in 0.4.0, to be removed in 0.5 with the other
 * startup migrations — see docs/upgrade-notes.md, "Startup migrations".
