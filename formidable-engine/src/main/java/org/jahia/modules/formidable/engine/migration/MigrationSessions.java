/**
 * Runs one workspace pass of a startup content migration in a system session.
 *
 * <p>The live pass is a SILENT rewrite: JCR observation is switched off while the callback
 * runs. Jahia's UGCListener treats every direct live write on a node published from default
 * as user-generated content — it stamps jmix:liveProperties and lists the written
 * properties in j:liveProperties, and the publication's ConflictResolver then skips those
 * properties for good, so a migrated field would never take a later publication into
 * account (#281). Disabling the listeners around the write is the core's own recipe for
 * system rewrites in live (jExperience's Migrator, the 7.3 rating patch).
 *
 * <p>The default pass keeps observation on: the runtime listeners maintain the editorial
 * invariants there, and the one listener a migration must dodge already checks
 * {@link ChoiceOptionsContentMigration#isMigrationWrite()}.
 *
 * <p>With observation off, the output-cache invalidation does not see the live changes
 * either: a live pass that rewrote anything flushes the output caches itself, cluster-wide,
 * so the published forms render the migrated content without a republish. A live pass
 * that fails flushes too — it saves node by node, so whatever it committed before dying
 * is live already. The flush is a best-effort follow-up on both paths: the content is
 * committed by then, and a cache hiccup must not fail the migration nor its component.
 *
 * <p>The module's other direct live writer, FormPublicationAclSyncListener, is not
 * concerned: the j:acl / ACE nodes it maintains are created in live and carry no
 * j:originWS, so the UGCListener ignores them — and it rewrites them on every publication
 * anyway. The rule above is about system rewrites of PUBLISHED nodes.
