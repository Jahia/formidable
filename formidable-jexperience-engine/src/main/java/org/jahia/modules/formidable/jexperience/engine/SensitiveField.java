/**
 * The author's "this field is sensitive": its value never leaves the site, and no mapping can be
 * made on it. Four readers share this one rule — the dropdown, which then offers nothing to pick;
 * the reader, so a mapping made before the flag never becomes a rule action; the render filter,
 * which leaves the field out of the page's configuration; and the response enricher, which leaves
 * its value out of the submission's answer. The last is the one that matters: whatever the editor
 * allowed, the value does not leave the server.
 *
 * <p><strong>When it holds.</strong> The rule and the page describe the published form, so they
 * follow the flag at the next publication, like every other property. The enricher does not wait for
 * one: it treats a field as sensitive when either workspace says so, because a control that reads
 * "this value never leaves the site" cannot be armed only by an act the author may not think to
 * perform (see {@code SubmissionEventEnricher.sendableFields}).</p>
