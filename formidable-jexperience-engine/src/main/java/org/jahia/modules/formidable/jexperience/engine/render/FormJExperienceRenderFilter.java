/**
 * Writes, before every form of a tracked site in live, what the client script needs: a JSON block
 * keyed on the form's UUID — {@code formId}, {@code name}, {@code path}, and the {@code prefill} pairs,
 * field to visitor profile property, for the fields the author asked to prefill — and the declaration
 * of the script as a static asset. What the form maps for sending is not in it: the accepted values
 * reach the script through the submission's answer (see {@code block}). The form's mappable fields are
 * registered as dependencies of the fragment: mapping one, or switching its prefill on, must refresh
 * a block the cache would otherwise keep until the form itself is republished.
 *
 * <p>The output depends on the published form alone, never on the visitor, so the fragment stays
 * cached and identical for everyone. Every form of a page declares the same asset, and core keeps one
 * per path in the head, so the script is fetched and run once whatever the number of forms — and that
 * one script, having every block of the page in front of it, asks the tracker for the union of the
 * prefill properties in a single {@code digitalDataOverrides} entry: nothing inline, nothing per form.</p>
 *
 * <p>The filter sits just inside the fragment cache — priority 17, after core's {@code CacheFilter} at 16.5 —
 * so that the block is stored with the form's fragment and the fields with its dependencies, and a cached
 * fragment costs neither a session nor a query. Below {@code AggregateFilter} (16.0) a filter also runs on
 * the pass where the aggregation stands a placeholder in for the form: its output is baked into the parent's
 * fragment, whose dependencies do not include the fields, and what it adds to the form's dependencies comes
 * after the cache stored them. Found on the instance: a form placed through a reference kept the block of
 * the last cache miss until the site cache was flushed.</p>
